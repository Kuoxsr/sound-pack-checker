# sound-pack-checker
This is a personal tool to check whether sounds.json matches the ogg files in the folder structure of a Minecraft resource pack.  I needed something to make this process quicker.

The goal of this simple project is to produce two lists:

* All the json lines that don't link to any ogg file
* All the ogg files that aren't mentioned in the json file
